Include necessary libraries: <cmath>, <cstdio>, <vector>, <iostream>, <algorithm>, and <string>.
Define a function check_compatibility that takes two characters a and b as input.
Inside the check_compatibility function, initialise a string flames with the string "FLAMES".
Find the index of a and b in the flames string and store them in a_index and b_index respectively.
If either a_index or b_index is 0, print an error message and return false.
If a_index is equal to b_index, return true.
If a_index is greater than b_index, recursively call check_compatibility with a and flames[a_index - 1] as input.
If a_index is less than or equal to b_index, recursively call check_compatibility with flames[b_index - 1] and b as input.
In the main function, declare two strings name1 and name2 to store the names of the two people.
Prompt the user to enter the first name and store it in name1.
Prompt the user to enter the second name and store it in name2.
Declare a character flame_char to store the sum of the ASCII values of the first characters of name1 and name2.
Convert flame_char to lowercase using the tolower function.
If the first characters of name1 and name2 are compatible, print a message indicating that they are compatible. Otherwise, print a message indicating that they are not compatible.
Return 0 from the main function.
